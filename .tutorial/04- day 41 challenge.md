# ðŸ‘‰ Day 41 Challenge

1. Create a dictionary that stores the following information about a website: name, URL, description and a star rating (out of 5).
2. Use a loop to output the names of the keys, ask the user to type in the details and store the input in the dictionary.
3. Finally, output the whole dictionary (keys and values).


ðŸ¥³ Extra points for getting all the inputs with just one `input` command and the `split` function.

Example:

```

Input the a star rating out of 5: *****

name:Replit, URL:replit.com, description:An awesome online IDE, rating:***** 
```

- When creating your dictionary, you will need to use `example = { "MyValue": none}` to show a key name and no value.
- Use a loop to `print` the entire dictionary.
- Make sure you include both variables (name and value) in your loop and your `print` statement.
